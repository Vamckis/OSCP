- In Local port forward, we can connect to one socket per connection.
- But, SSH provides dynamic port forwarding. From single listening port from SSH client, packets can be forwarded to any socket that SSH swerver host have access to.
- We connect via ssh, and can access any port that PgDB has access to.

## Connect to SMB port and Do fullscan on HR shares.
### Connect from Conf01 to PgDB using 
- Dynamic port flag is -D

### Using Proxychains as SocksProxy
- To create SSH tunneling, we need to use SMB 445 on PgDB
- SMB clinet donot have native socks proxy, so use proxychains
